## Yelp data
If a place has Yelp details (rating/photos), the app fetches those details via a backend proxy. We show attribution and link out to Yelp.

## Tracking
We do not use data for cross-app tracking and do not request App Tracking Transparency (ATT).

## Data retention
Backend request logs, if retained, are kept for operational purposes. Favorites remain on your device until you remove them or uninstall the app.
